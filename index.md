### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic that was covered in our domain this quarter was LCA. Before learning about this algorithm, the only exposure I had with classification was in a supervised setting. When it came to unsupervised learning, I didn't really know how algorithms were able to group data points together without a given label. It was really interesting to learn how LCA was able to look at the patterns in the data and be able to group similar data points together. We used LCA to look at patient data and were able to classify them into 6 different classes based on their medical history. The post-analysis was also pretty cool to do as we realized that after running the model, there were still things we could do to tweak the classification. For example, the research paper we followed removed groups that contained less than 5% of the sample and we had to figure out how to remove and reclassify patients. 


### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project is to see if we can try to create some kind of personalized treatment plan depending on their medical history. In the Quarter 1 Project, we focused on figuring out the existence of different patient subgroups and how sepsis affects each of them. The paper mentioned how depending on the subgroup, a different kind of treatment could be necessary, but they didn't elaborate on that. Maybe we could fill in that gap and continue where the paper left off. We could classify which patient was in a subgroup and then build a recommender system to figure out a treatment plan for them. 


### **3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would've make to our approach was to focus on documentation more. While coding and setting up our GitHub, we left documentation to be the last thing to do. Even after we would finish a script, there would be times where we wouldn't go back and document it right away. As the weeks went on, we realized that we were behind on the documentation side of things and made it more of a priority to do. Documenting was harder than we anticipated since we forgot a lot of the things we did and had to take the time to figure it out. In the end, it wasn't that bad but we definitely could've been more efficient with our time if we documented things as we went. When we start our own project in Quarter 2, we will definitely make it more of a priority to document things as we go.


### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I think I would like a lesson on the terminal. There are a lot of things that the terminal can do and it kind of intimidates me a bit. I know how to use git and basic things like navigating the directory, but I know there's more that I can do with it. I feel like my workflow could be way more efficient if I knew how to use the terminal properly. For example, I could use it to open files way faster than having to pull up my system's file manager and navigate to it. I know there is more that the terminal can do besides just open files for you and I want to learn more about it.
